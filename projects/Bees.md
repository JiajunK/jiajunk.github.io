<h2> A Unity Clicker Game </h2>

<p> Inspired by the famous game "Mayo Clicker", this game is a clicker game where the user repeatedly click the bee on screen and evolve the bee. Collect all the cute little bees to complete the game </p>
<h2> Game Play </h2>
<p> Although simple, the concept is to have the player click a different combination of times before hitting the evolve button. By clicking "polinate", it also adds a different route to the evolution tree. If I were to make this a full game, then there would be a Beepedia featuring all the bees, and achievements for players when they get the certain bee. </p>
<h2> Time to Completion </h2>
<p> This game was created in 12 hours, which makes it one of my shortest project yet. I wanted to see how much progress can I really make if I sat myself down and work on one thing for an extended amount of time. The result was this game. </p>
<h2> Affinity Designer </h2>
<p> I used my trusty Wacom Bamboo drawing tablet I bought in 2014 paired with Affinity Designer for this project. Before this game, I had a lot of experience using Adobe Photoshop. I have an outdated version of Photoshop (before it became subscription based), and wanted to try something new. Affinity Designer happened to go on sale, so I thought this was a perfect opportunity. All the drawings of the bees were done on Affinity Designer, and these are the first artworks I have made on the software. </p>
