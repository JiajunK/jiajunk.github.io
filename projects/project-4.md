Have you ever wished you had a catalog of where you can stay for over 12 hours crying over your physics final? Well look no futher as Akamai Nook is here to save the day!
</p>

<br>
<p>Akamai Nook is developed by three people including myself as a project for my ICS 314 course. We were tasked to design a webpage using Meteor, Semantic UI react, and MongoDB. This project was by far the most challenging project I had for this course. There were unbelieveable amount of stress poured into this piece.

<br>
<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>
The Akamai Nook can be used by anyone and offers a catalog of locations that one could study at. There are brief descriptions, an image, and hour of operations displayed on each location. Users may also create their own locations to share for other people.

<h3>Responsibilities</h3>
<p>
The primary role I had was the landing page, the profile page, and the UI. Now the profile page have an icon the user can choose, Nooks they have added, and ability to change user password. Out of all those features user icon was by far the hardest thing. Changing password had many documentations online that I could refer to, and having Nooks they uploaded was also relatively easy to implement. However having a profile picture came out in my nightmares. Unfortunately in the final version, because master was corrupted, profile was missing the added nook feature. As for the UI, designing the logo, touching up color scheme, and going with a font theme was over all very fun. The artistic side of web design appealed to me a lot.

<h3>Experience</h3>
<p>
This was the first time I was working on a GitHub project with other people, so merging was a very nerve wrecking process. We were very careful in the beginning with merging correct things into master. However on the very last day master branch was totally destroyed and having multiple people reverting changes made it worse. Overall there were many difficulties learning GitHub as we go.

<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>To begin, I have an upload speed of less than 1mbps.</p>

<p>
Normally, upload speed does not affect my productivity as much, however in our case, I was the person that was supposed to deploy the website. It took a whooping 30 minutes to get an connection error during deployment, and I gave three attempts before I had to finally give up and ask my team mates. Now normally this would not have a problem, but there was some difficulties getting the correct version of master branch for us. In the end there were many loose ends for the projects that I should have caught but ended up on the final deployment.
