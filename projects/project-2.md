summary: An emergency app concept to aid potential victims of kidnapping, harassment, and/or assult.
---

The concept of the app we named "Malama" was an always listening app that will aid you by triggering specific key words. Say you are running alone, had a night out from the club, or just in potential danger. By using custom key words such as "help me malama," "don't come closer," "I need help", the app will trigger a social alarm. Specified contacts will receive text messages asking for help and will include the location. Specified social media accounts will automatically post the location and automated help message as well. User may opt to call the emergency line, record audio, or record video. The concept of this phone app is still in the air and perhaps in the future I will make this app happen.
