Fun with Knex cars!
<br>
<br>
For AP physics in my senior year, we were tasked with creating the ultimate knex car that will destroy all other knex cars. This was a great way to learn physics hands on and I also had a blast editing and creating this video.
<br>
The video was edited though Adobe Premiere. My hardware had a hard time processing and rending the video, and everything was filmed on our phones. Dispite the setbacks, we were proud to present our journey to create our ultimate knex car.
