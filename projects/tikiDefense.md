<h3>What is Tiki Defense?</h3>
<p>Tiki Defense is a game where the player can play using a mobile device with a camera, aim at a printable map for the level, and play interactively with the real life. Just like any tower defense, the player must defend their home base from enemy invasion using various tikis. Defeating each enemy will gain the player currency in which they can purchase more Tikis. The catch is that if the player have Tiki Cards in real life, they can summon special tikis at no additional cost, and can even freely move them around the map to save the day.

<h3>Language and Program</h3>
<p>This game is created in Unity using the Vuforia engine. Almost all of the models are from free Unity assets, which are all listed in the project Github page. The script is in C#.</p>
