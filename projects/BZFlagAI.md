<h3>What is BZFlags?</h3>
<p>BZFlags is a free online multiplayer game available on Windows, Mac, and Linux. BZFlag is a capture the flag style shooter game where the player controls a tank. It can either be played as a team game where the teams are grouped by colors or a free for all. The objective of the game is to go to an enemy base, capture the enemy flag, and return to the playerâ€™s base with the flag. When a flag is captured, the team that lost its flag will lose a point, while the team with the successful capture will gain a point.

<h3>Language and Program</h3>
<p>This game was complied within Microsoft Visual Studios, using C++. The original source code for the game is available <a href="https://www.bzflag.org/">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Changes made</h3>
<p>The original AI we had to modify had limited functionalities. This project was done by myself and one other team member. Here are the list of things we have implemented for this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>A* search algorithm</li>
<li>Alignment, Cohesion, and Separation behaviors</li>
<li>Decision tree</li>
</ul>
