<p>A children need its playground as a programmer needs its workspace. 
For ICS 314, I was introduced to Intellij for the first time, and so far it has been nothing but confusion. 
The format I was most comfortable in was Eclipse, which shared similarities and differences with Intellij. </p>

#Initialization

<p>To start off, Intellij was an absolute nightmare. 
There were countless amount of settings, options, and add-ons. 
Once I thought it was all good to go, errors pop up from left and right screaming at me to download more things. 
The initial set up was so confusing I felt like a toddler crawling into the White House meeting room. 
Fortunately, I have timed the initial set up and it took me a total of 55 minutes to get everything running. 
Compared with Eclipse, which would just run smoothly after the download, Intellij gave me a horrible first impression. </p>
<br>
<br>
#Usage

<p> Usage wise, Intellij was neither horrible nor amazing. 
As a beginner programmer, the most important function a workspace could have is to tell me what I am doing wrong. 
As long as Intellij can tell me my styling errors and syntax errors, and with some suggestions to fix them, I have no complains with the usage of Intellij. 
Some minor complaints I have would be the default spacing style.
As far as I am concerned, there are two types of programmers. Ones that care about spacing and want to take a quick glance to know which curly brace close which one,
and monsters who only care about condensing their lines of code.  
Whenever I hit the beautiful tidy up button, the code will automatically set it that the opening curly brace would be on the same line as the code (I know, horrible!).</p>

#Overall
<p>
Playing with Intellij and ESLint, there are no major complaints but no major excitement over it either. 
Perhaps after using it a little more I will find more pros and cons for this application. 
As of right now, it is usable and what more can I ask for?
