<h3>Japanese Translation Work Sample</h3>
<br>
<p>As part of my Japanese course, I took up a translation project. The original text was written in a Japanese. Below, I have the source text, the translation, and the translation protocols. </p>

<p>コレステロールと動脈硬化</p>
<p>
血液や血管の状態を悪化させる原因は様々であり、過食、偏食、食品添加物、ストレス、喫煙、運動不足などが、血液中に不要な物を増やし、血管に負担をかけています。中でもコレステロールの過剰　な摂取は、動脈硬化を進行させる大きな原因です。
</p>
<p>
動脈は内膜、中膜、外膜の３層になっており、正常な状態ではこの３層は隙間無く並んでいますが、内膜を保護する内皮細胞が傷つくと隙間ができ、そこから血液の成分、特にコレステロールなどの脂分が血管に侵入します。
</p>
<p>
この侵入した異物を取り込むのが白血球のひとつであるマクロファージであり、マクロファージは異物がある限り取り込み続け、しまいにはマクロファージ自身の細胞膜が破れて、取り込んだ異物をまき散らすことになります。
</p>
<p>
するとまた別のマクロファージがやってきて取り込みを開始するのですが、これを繰り返すうちに、どんどん内膜の傷が悪化することになるのです。その上、血管壁を治すために血小板が集まり、血の固まりができます。
</p>
<p>
結果的には内膜は膨れ上がり、血液の通り道は狭くなり、血液が詰まりやすい状態に陥るのです。その時、血液がサラサラでなくドロドロだったら、いっそう詰まりやすくなるのは避けられません。
</p>
<p>
コレステロールによる動脈硬化はこのような仕組み で起こります。つまり、コレステロール値が高いということは、動脈硬化が起こりやすい、進行しやすいということを意味しているのです。
</p>
<p>
コレステロールに善玉と悪玉があるのはご存じのかたも多いと思います。血液中のコレステロールはタンパク質と結びつき、リポタンパク質 ＬＤＬ、ＨＤＬとして存在しています。
</p>
<p>
ＬＤＬは各細胞にコレステロールを運び、ＨＤＬは細胞から余分なコレステロールを回収するという役割がありますが、コレステロールが過剰になるとＬＤＬが増加し、動脈硬化の原因となるのです。そこで通称、ＬＤＬは悪玉コレステロール、ＨＤＬは善玉コレステロールと呼ばれています。
</p>
<p>
ＬＤＬ、ＨＤＬの２種類のコレステロールのバランスを正常に保つには、食生活が重要なポイントとなります。コレステロールの過剰摂取を改め、善玉を増やす食品を多く摂ることで血液や血管はずいぶんきれいに保てるのです。

Cholesterol is Hardening Your Arteries
</p>
<p>
Overeating, unbalanced diet, food additives, stress, smoking, and lack of exercise are some of the many factors that deteriorate a person’s blood and blood vessels. Unnecessary substances will enter the bloodstream, causing stress to the blood vessels. One of the biggest reasons atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries, occur is due to an excessive intake of cholesterol.
</p>
<p>
The artery is composed of three layers: the inner layer (intima), the middle layer (media), and the outer layer (adventitia). In a healthy artery, the three layers have no gaps in between them; however, when the endothelial cells, the cells that line and protect the intima, are damaged, a gap will be made. Fat particles such as cholesterol will then enter the blood vessel from that gap along with other components of the blood.
</p>
<p>
A type of white blood cell called macrophage will then capture foreign substances that have entered the bloodstream. The macrophage will continuously take in foreign substances until its own cell membrane rips, ultimately scattering the captured foreign substances everywhere.
</p>
<p>
Another macrophage will try to capture the foreign substance, which causes a cycle that worsens the initial damage on the intima. In addition, a type of cell fragment called the platelet will gather up in order to repair the damages in the blood vessel wall, thus creating blood clots. 
</p>
<p>
As a result, the intima swells up and the blood pathway becomes narrower. This consequently means that the person is at a higher risk of getting blood clots. Especially for a person with thicker blood (such as a diabetic person), an increased risk is inevitable. 
</p>
<p>
Under these conditions, the arteries will harden. Meaning the higher the cholesterol intake, the higher chance of developing atherosclerosis.
</p>
<p>
Many people may already know there are two types of cholesterols, a good one and a bad one. The cholesterol in the bloodstream will bind with protein cells to create two types of lipoprotein cells: LDL, low-density lipoproteins, and HDL, high-density lipoproteins. 
</p>
<p>
LDL carries cholesterol to individual cells and HDL retrieves excessive cholesterol from cells. Arteriosclerosis occurs when the amount of LDL increases from excessive cholesterol intake. Thus, people commonly refer to LDL as bad cholesterols and HDL as good cholesterols.
</p>
<p>
The key to maintaining a balance between LDL and HDL is the person’s diet. Limiting the cholesterol intake, and consuming more food that contains HDL will help preserve healthy blood and blood vessels.
</p>
<br>
<h4>Translation Protocol</h4>
<br>
<p>
Initially, I did not contain the word atherosclerosis in the initial paragraph as I thought I could keep it as “hardening of the arteries”. However, since the paper mentions the term many times, it only made sense to introduce this term early on in the paper. I decided to add “atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries” as the Japanese source text is self-explanatory, while the English term is not. 
</p>
<p>
The structure of the scientific words was a bit tricky, as it was easily flooded with commas. I ended up using parentheses to minimize the use of commas and make it easier to read. I made minor grammatical adjustments for the next paragraph, such as past tense vs present tense vs future tense. Reading it over, adding the term “will” made the paragraph flow much better.
</p>
<p>
I changed some words such as “hurt” to “damaged” and also fixed the tense of the entire paragraph. 正常な状態means “in regular cases”, which regular would mean a healthy one. 
</p>
<p>
My initial sentence was “ultimately causing the foreign substances to spread everywhere”, which was reduced to “ultimately scattering the captured foreign substances everywhere” to simplify the sentence. 
</p>
<p>
My tense and singular/plural were inconsistent in this paragraph, which was adjusted. Instead of saying “damages the intima farther”, I realized it could just be a simple “worsen the intima”. I left out the 集まり in the first draft accidentally, and use the word “try to repair…” instead of “will gather…” which was a fidelity issue. 
</p>
<p>
For this paragraph, I wanted to stick with the “diabetic person” instead of “thicker blood” because “thick blood” is barely used in English. I have never heard of the term thick blood as a health perspective and did not believe that will get the point across. I searched up different sources of what causes blood clots, and according to both MayoClinic and Healthline, diabetes and obesity was a leading cause. Then, I searched on Japanese websites of what exactly constitutes as サラサラ blood. The result was that it was a media catch copy created in the year 2000 to describe blood that is not high in fat content and flows better in the blood vessels. I realized instead of trying to translate this catch copy it was much better to just include what are people who are at risk of a blood clot, which is diabetes. Since this is an over translation, I kept it in parenthesis as a clarification of the “thick blood” instead of just replacing it completely. 
</p>
<p>
このような仕組みで起こります is translated into “under these conditions”. The literal would be “these mechanisms” but that would not be a very good transition. 
</p>
<p>
I tried to use the term “categorize” instead of “know” but it seems like it turned into a fidelity issue. This paragraph also had tense and plural issues. 
</p>
<p>
Since the abbreviation for LDL and HDL are ...lipoproteins, they are plural. I did not realize that so my grammar was off for this paragraph as well. Parallel structure was used for this paragraph to make it flow better.
</p>
<p>
I switched the sentence structure around for this final paragraph, putting the “the key to…” first and “is the person’s diet” last. Then instead of having “to maintain a healthy bloodstream, limit…” I flipped this structure around to “Limiting… will preserve healthy blood”. Finally, I somehow read the text wrong and had “containing LDL will help the blood” instead of HDL, which is a major fidelity issue. 
</p>
