<h3>Art of Web</h3>
<br>

<p>
  A spider takes on average one hour to create an intricate, death silk trap we call "web". The web allures unsuspecting preys and enslave them for hours, days, and possibly for the rest of their life. How silly of these creatures to fall for such basic traps such as webs? Spiders are not new creatures, it is said that spiders have been on Earth for 380 million years, and spiders have made webs for around 100 million years. Surely, both predators and preys have evolved simultaneously to ensure survival. If I were to reincarnate into a spider for my next life, how could I both utilize what my ancestors have set me up for, as well as prepare for a new generation of preys?

<h3>My First Day living as a spider</h3>
  <p>
    Sure, my mama-spider could teach me how she caught a giant wasp and my dada-spider could team me how he caught a whole human face, but what if I want to express my own uniqueness? Surely, a new generation of prey will require a new generation of thinking. What if instead of the traditional approach, I just change the entirety of my web, both production wise and product wise. Instead of creating my web from shooting silk and weaving it for what seems like forever, I will create my own material that's not silk and spread it in a design never seen before. How unique and interesting would that be for me to create! The end result will be something completely different, that those cursed butterflies will have no idea what's coming (or more so, what's stationary and what they are flying into.) I wanted to ask mama how can I make my own, super-unique silk that no other spider have, but instead I got laughed at. Change is great, but if there are presets for me why would I put in the extra effort for something that may not even work? Is it really worth the effort to invest in fixing something that is not broken? I understood exactly what she meant, and decided to keep using the material I was given, but try the new design approach. However, would the butterfly actually get trapped in a web that is vastly different from the usual? Perhaps the weaving of the silk is a must so that butterflies will be unable to remove themselves from the web, and changing the design would cause them to leave easily. After pondering for what seems like decades I realized that all of these are merely an illusion of choices, and if I want my web to survive I should follow what my ancestors have been doing.

  <h3>But change when?</h3>
  <p>
  I may have been discouraged to create my own material for the web or having a different pattern of weave, but I still had a burning question in my mind: how are we going to evolve with the times? None of these preys are the same, how do we know which one we want to catch? After observing all the great webs that have been put out by my ancestors, I have learned that there are multiple types of web design that have different advantages and disadvantages. Some webs are so dependent a certain string of the weave that the whole thing may fall apart when the butterfly struggle and flap in the web, however, could be easy to create. Some webs are greatly structured, looks great on the surface, could be fixed easily when broken, but have a horrible way of securing itself and may be broken easily by a curious cat. The list of webs went on and on... and as an amateur web-creator, I just wanted to try something basic that works first. Without thinking too much in-depth about the design, I got my hands wet and shot out my filaments. I realized that my web was not black and white. I mean, color-wise it is, I was only able to shoot out grey webs at the very best, but I mean the design of the web. A web does not have to be a traditional hexagonal weave or the good 'ol Star of David weave. I realized weaving webs have so many different aspects, that following my ancestors is merely a start and I could have a combination of many designs to have my own design. Of course, overall it may lean towards a specific type, but if it does there is probably a good reason for it to do so. If by combing designs and adapting to what I want and need it attracts a new type of insect, then I have made another step towards evolution.

    <h3>Being a spider is tough</h3>
  <p>
The more webs I studied the more complicated it got. There are different models, controlling the weave, and the presentation of the weave. Each component changes how the web will behave and look. Who knew something that has been around for so many years has such a complicated structure! I sure have much more to learn.

Now if you will excuse me, I have some bugs on my web to take care of.
