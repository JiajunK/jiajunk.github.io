<h3>
Reflection on JavaScript
</h3>

As a assignment for ICS314, we were tasked to do what felt like a billion JavaScript practices on 
  <a href="https://www.FreeCodeCamp.com">Free Code Camp</a>
Fortunately for me, this was not the first time coding in JavaScript. Unfortunately for me, the website was faulty and I had to redo half of the exercises.

The core of JavaScript was not too far off from Java, which made a lot of these exercises easier to process in my mind. 
Thing such as for loops and while loops had the general same format. Of course, comparisons and math were very similar as well. 
Something that threw me off guard was making objects and arrays. 
The number of commas and brackets and curly braces could get extremely confusing without good code style (though, even with good code format, it could get confusing). 
However, it is hard to say JavaScript is a “bad” coding language just because a single aspect of it gets confusing. 
So far, JavaScript has not caused myself any troubles, and I can see myself using JavaScript more often if I want to make myself a webpage. 
For a code that runs a webpage, I think it is sufficient to fulfill its duties. 
What does not fulfill its duties sufficiently on the other end, was the website itself.

Free code camp is a great place to start off JavaScript for free. 
Unfortunately, there are just so much hand-holding and given the time constraint from my course, it was difficult for me to fully absorb the contents. 
After doing multiple of these practices, the goal of them started to feel like completion, not absorption. 
Hopefully, I will be able to create my own project soon that will incorporate these JavaScript codes, which I will be able to fully understand. 
As for something to kick start JavaScript, this was a stressful but fun assignment.
