<p>In my final semester of college I was tasked with seven other students to create an interactive web page that can track the carbon emissions of people driving to and from work every day. This application was done with JavaScript, SemanticUI, React, and Meteor. The concept was simple, each student will take care of a component, and we will merge the changes together every two weeks when the milestones are due. However, due to this being a pandemic semester, things were not as easy as we thought. </p>

<h3>Pandemic Learning</h3>
<p>To begin, we never saw anyone face to face at all. This took away our body language and the frustration we had towards each other, as we could not tell emotions through keyboards. This led to the fallout of one of our team members, as they felt their words were not getting through to the rest of the group, resulting in that team member leaving the project halfway through. The second problem of a pandemic semester was people taking up other commitments. We had difficulty gathering everyone up after class for a meeting as people did not have to physically be at a classroom at a specific time, resulting in them picking up more commitments that overlapped in time. All these social problems of a pandemic delayed the progress of our project significantly. </p>

<h3>Regardless...</h3>
<p>In the end, even with the setbacks we were able to produce something we were proud of. I specifically took on more of a front-end role, making sure all the color scheme, logo, and fonts were consistent with the look of our project. As the project was coming towards completion, I also helped out in the backend database, expanding into things I was not previously familiar with. This was a stressful yet fun project to end my college career with, and I am forever grateful for my professor and teammates for making it happen. </p>
