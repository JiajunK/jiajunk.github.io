<h3>Hey Google, Am I Stupid?</h3>

As I internally screech for Jesus and his messiahs to reap my soul on the third all-nighter I am pulling for my 10-page research paper, my mother would come into my room and scuff at how easy research papers must be now. 
Of course, nowadays all the answers to the burning questions we ever have is just a few taps away. 
Inventions such as Google Homes or Amazon Echo even allows voice to voice interactive questions. 
Add that with professor Wikipedia and its TA control-F, anything should be answered within minutes. 
Unfortunately, for people like my grandmother, my 50-year-old co-worker, Shilder college of business students, or my dog, asking for help on the internet is still a difficult task for them.
Too often I will see people asking for help in the wrong community, such as asking for their homework help on Facebook or going on Yelp to find out how good of a library Hamilton Library is. 
Because the possibility of stupid questions is endless, I have decided to look at StackOverflow as a sole provider of good and bad questions a person can ask on the great internet.
<h2>Say that again?</h2>
Who would have thought frantically asking for help in a help forum is redundant and does not convey a good message? 
  User afraj morshed from <a href = "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54354379/please-show-ne-how-to-to-thismath-random-and-die-class">this forum</a> sure did. 
I understand I will get a lot of hatred from this statement, but standard English is not that hard to achieve. 
As someone who is evidently learning Java should already know this existence of this great invention called “spell check”. 
Just by using correct spelling, the readability of the question improves drastically. 
Now grammar check is a relatively new thing that can catch simple grammar errors, which I would also highly recommend for afraj morshed. 
Ignoring the spelling and grammatical errors, this post is still a train wreck. Half of the title conveys nothing about the information, there is no foundation of his code to work with, and smells like a homework problem. 
It is a given fact that many people on stack overflow use it as a homework help medium, but the goal is to not let other people find out you are a useless 5th year ICS student struggling to set up a for loop.

<h2>Good Question!</h2>
Concise yet descriptive title, Nathan H posted <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/513832/how-do-i-compare-strings-in-java">a question</a> which received 727 votes and 3.5 million views. 
The language is specified, what this person tried is mentioned, and shows a general foundation of the knowledge. 
People are much more willing to help someone who has given an attempt at researching the problem. 
Questions like this could be googled by others who asks similar questions, making the visibility of this question much higher. 
Instead of just asking “what is .equals()”, Nathan H asks what is the difference, when to use which, and how he encountered the differences. 
This allowed other users to know exactly how to answer his question.

<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
Even though a newborn baby cannot verbally say “mother, my stomach seeks breast milk, please give me the nutrients I need to grow to become a functioning member of the society,” 
people will actively seek out what a baby needs. 
Unfortunately, people do not come up to programmers and actively seek out what is wrong with our code. 
Using smart questions to ask smart people is the only way programmers can survive in this information era. Us “hackers” are only human, tackling this massive system of information and technology. 
Polite and accurate grammar, concise and descriptive title, knowing where to post is a great way to access the information floating around. 
Until the art of asking smart questions online is more of common sense, there will always be people asking stupid questions online.
